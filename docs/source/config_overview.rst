Configuration Overview
======================

While Jupyter Notebook installs with default configuration settings, Jupyter
Notebook provides a rich array of options that may be configured to suit
your workflow. Let's explore four areas of configuration:

- Jupyter's Common Configuration system
- Notebook server
- Notebook front-end client
- Notebook extensions


:ref:`Security in Jupyter notebooks <notebook_security>` is a topic worthy of
serious consideration. Since security policies will vary from organization to
organization, we encourage you to consult with your security team on settings
that would be best for your use cases. Our documentation offers some
responsible security practices, and we recommend that you become familiar
with the practices.
