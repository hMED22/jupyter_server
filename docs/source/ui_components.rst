UI Components
=============
When opening bug reports or sending emails to the Jupyter mailing list, it is
useful to know the names of different UI component so that other developers
and users have an easier time helping you diagnose your problems. This section
of the documentation is designed to familiarize you with the different names
of UI elements and the different states that UI elements can be in.

When you launch ``jupyter notebook`` the first page that you encounter is the
Notebook Dashboard.

Once you've selected a Notebook to edit, the Notebook will open in the Notebook
Editor.

If you would like to learn more about the specific elements within the Notebook
Editor, you can go through the User Interface Tour by selecting Help in the
menubar then selecting User Interface Tour.

When a cell is in edit mode, the Cell Mode Indicator will change to reflect
the cell's state.

Now let's say that you've chosen to open a Markdown file instead of a Notebook
file whilst in the Notebook Dasboard. If so, the file will be opened in the
File Editor.
